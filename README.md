## Abstract
<details>
<summary><b>TL; DR</b> We introduce BEV-VAE, a variational autoencoder that unifies multi-view images into a BEV representation for generalizable autonomous driving scene synthesis. </summary>
Generative modeling has shown remarkable success in vision and language, inspiring research on synthesizing driving scenes. Existing multi-view synthesis approaches typically operate in image latent spaces with cross-attention to enforce spatial consistency, but they are tightly bound to camera configurations, which limits model generalization. We propose BEV-VAE, a variational autoencoder that learns a unified Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) representation from multi-view images, enabling encoding from arbitrary camera layouts and decoding to any desired viewpoint. Through multi-view image reconstruction and novel view synthesis, we show that BEV-VAE effectively fuses multi-view information and accurately models spatial structure. This capability allows it to generalize across camera configurations and facilitates scalable training on diverse datasets. Within the latent space of BEV-VAE, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) generates BEV representations conditioned on 3D object layouts, enabling multi-view image synthesis with enhanced spatial consistency on nuScenes and achieving the first complete seven-view synthesis on AV2. Compared with training generative models in image latent spaces, BEV-VAE achieves superior computational efficiency. Finally, synthesized imagery significantly improves the perception performance of BEVFormer, highlighting the utility of generalizable scene synthesis for autonomous driving.

## Method
### Overall architecture of BEV-VAE with DiT for multi-view image generation.
![framework](./assets/framework.png)
In Stage 1, BEV-VAE learns to encode multi-view images into a spatially compact latent space in BEV and reconstruct them, ensuring spatial consistency. In Stage 2, DiT is trained with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in this latent space to generate BEV representations from random noise, which are then decoded into multi-view images.

## Getting Started
### Environment Setup
First, create and activate a conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n bevvae python=3.10
conda activate bevvae
```
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Czm369/bev-vae.git
```
#### Dependencies
The code is tested with <b>Python 3.10.x</b> and <b>CUDA 12.x</b>.

Install PyTorch according to your CUDA version:
##### CUDA 12.1
```bash
pip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```
##### CUDA 12.8
```bash
pip install torch==2.7.0 torchvision==0.22.0 torchaudio==2.7.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```
#### Install BEV-VAE

```bash
cd ${ROOT}
pip install requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Data Preparation
#### nuScenes
1. Download the nuScenes dataset from the [website](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes) and and place it under `./data/`. 
2. Download the BEV-VAE preprocessed data from the [website](https://huggingface.co/datasets/czm369/nusc_bev-lidar). This repository provides additional data required by BEV-VAE, including BEV latent representations (`nusc_bev-lidar_train.tar.gz` and `nusc_bev-lidar_val.tar.gz`) encoded from nuScenes.These BEV latents can be decoded into multi-view images using nuScenes (or other compatible, such as AV2) camera configurations. The provided BEV latents can be directly used to train DiT, significantly reducing training cost by skipping the BEV-VAE encoding stage.

## Experiments

### Datasets
This study uses four multi-camera autonomous driving datasets that differ substantially in scale, camera configuration, annotated categories, and recording locations. Despite these differences, all datasets provide full 360° coverage of the surrounding scene.

| Dataset  | #Frames | #Cameras | #Classes |                    Recording Locations                       |

We introduce a new hybrid autonomous driving dataset configuration, <b>PAS</b>, which combines nu<b>P</b>lan, <b>A</b>V2, and nu<b>S</b>cenes.

### Multi-view Image Reconstruction
BEV-VAE learns unified BEV representations by reconstructing multi-view images, integrating semantics from all camera views while modeling 3D spatial structure. Reconstruction metrics provide an indirect evaluation of the quality of the learned BEV representations. For reference, we compare with SD-VAE, a foundational model trained on LAION-5B, which encodes a single $256\times256$ image into a $32 \times32\times4$ latent. In contrast, BEV-VAE encodes multiple $256\times256$ views into a $32\times32\times16$ BEV latent, facing the more challenging task of modeling underlying 3D structure.
